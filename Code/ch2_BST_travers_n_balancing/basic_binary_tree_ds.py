# Task:
# develop a in-memory data structure to manage profile information (name, username and email)
# for 100 million users it should allow the following operations to be done efficiently


# 1)State problem clearly, identify the input and output formats
# 1. Insert: the profile information for a new user
# 2. Find:the profile information of a user, givenb their username
# 3. Update: the profile information of a user, given their username
# 4. List: all the profile information of all the users, sorted by username

# 2)Come up with Example I/P and O/Ps
# name = "vivek" email = "vivek@gmail.com"
# name = "vivek" email = "vivek@gmail.com"
# name = "vivek" email = "vivek@gmail.com"

# 1. insert
# 2. find
# 3. update
# 4. list

# 3) comeup with a correct solution. state it in a plain english
# Solution: we will store Users in Sorted list by name
# and variouos functions can be implemmented as:
# 1. Insert: loop through users and insert element in way it keeps the list sorted e.g.('farhan' < 'tushar')
# 2. Find:   loop through the list and find match
# 3. Update: loop through the list and findd matching query and update that user
# 4: List:   return all users 

# 4)Implement the solution and tets with example I/P and O/Ps


# after acknowledging inefficiency of linear datastructure example, 
# we need a structure like bellow given example (Binary-Tree):

# for this example we will use Binary-Tree as our data structure
# 1)keys and values: keys are user names and values are User objects, it often reffered as 
# keymap or treemap
# 2) Binary Search Tree: a binary tree in which each node has at most two children,
# the left child is less than the parent and the right child is greater than the parent,
# in other words, the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key
# 3) Balanced Tree: a binary tree in which the difference between the height of the left subtree
# and the right subtree is not more than one, in other words, the difference between the height

# Height of a binary tree: the number of leaves in the tree
# for a tree of height k: here's the list of numbers of nodes at each level
'''
    Level 0: 1
    Level 1: 2
    Level 2: 4 i.e. 2^2
    Level 3: 8 i.e. 2^3 
    ...
    Level k-1: 2^(k-1)
    Level k: 2^k

    # here what we are trying to determine is what is a relationship between the height of the tree and
    the total number of nodes in that tree

    if the total number of nodes in tree is n, then it follows that
    N = 1 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1)
    BST time complexity
    N+1=2^ k-1+2 ^k-1

    N+1=> 2^k-1 + 2^k-1
    N+1=> 2*(2^k-1)
    N+1=> 2^1â‹…2^k-1
    N+1=> 2^k

    k = log(N+1)
