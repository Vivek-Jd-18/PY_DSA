# Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree and AVL Trees: Self balanced binary tree remains balanced after every insertion
# and deletion, there are many approaches have been discovered to make self-balancing binary search tree
# like AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, B-Trees etc.

# Since each rotaion takes constant time, and at most log N rotations  may be required, this 
# operation is more efficient rather creating a binary search tree from scratch, allowing insertion 
# and deletion  to be performed in O(log N) time.


# Quesions : 
# 1) Implement Rotation and self-balancing Insertion
# 2) Implement deletion of a node from a  binary search tree
# 3) Implement deletion of a node from BST(with Balancing)
# 4) Find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree(Hint : use parent property)
# 5) Find the nest node in lexicographical order for a given node
# 6) Given number k, find the k-th node in BST.
